8. What was the highest original price in the Dillardâ€™s database of the item with SKU 3631365?

However it's a very simple question, I am pretty sure everyone will stick on this problem for a while. 
Because we should use the table 'skstinfo_fix' instead of 'skstinfo'.

So the query should be :

select top 1 retail from skstinfo_fix where SKU='3631365' order by retail desc;
